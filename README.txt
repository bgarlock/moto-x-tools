Moto X Tools
============

Moto X Tools is a collection of scripts to help you manage your Motorola Moto X.

Currently, there is only the moto-x-flash tool, which reads the XML file from
FXZ stock firmware to flash your device back to stock. Usually, these FXZ zip
files are read by a tool called RSDLite. This script is a replacement for that.
